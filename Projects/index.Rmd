The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is Toronto's public transportation system. It is a vast network that covers Toronto and the surrounding municipalities, which are collectively known as the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The bus system is extensive, with routes that reach almost every corner of the city. The TTC operates subways, buses, and streetcars throughout the region.

**The data for this analysis includes information on only buses**. 

The **data set** is **skewed** because it primarily includes data for **late buses**. This means that it does not provide a good representation of on-time buses. The data set contains data for the first six months of 2022, from **January to June**.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./Media/bus.JPG")

```


```{r intro, echo= FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rows_and_columns <- dim(ttc)
cat("Number of rows and columns:", rows_and_columns[1], "rows,", rows_and_columns[2], "columns\n")

# How many unique routes
unique_routes <- length(unique(ttc$route))
cat("Number of unique BUS ROUTES:", unique_routes, "\n")


```


```{r date,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(ttc, aes(x = date, y = min_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = "1 month",  # Set breaks to 1 month
    date_labels = "%b %Y",    # Format labels as abbreviated month and year
    limits = c(min(ttc$date), max(ttc$date))  # Set limits based on your data
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Date and Bus Delay",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Min Delay"
  )

```

# Does the frequency of bus delays vary with the season? 

The data supplied 15 incidents for why the bus was late. The data provided **15 reasons** for the bus being late. The following is a table of the reasons, their frequency, and the percentage of occurrences:

```{r why, echo= FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
incident_counts <- ttc %>%
  group_by(incident) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

# Calculate total occurrences
total_occurrences <- nrow(ttc)

# Add a column for percentages
incident_counts <- incident_counts %>%
  mutate(percentage = round((count / total_occurrences) * 100, 2))  # Round to 2 decimal places

# Arrange by percentage in descending order
incident_counts <- incident_counts %>%
  arrange(desc(percentage))

# Use kableExtra for styling
incident_counts %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling("hover", full_width = FALSE) %>%
  kable_classic(lightable_options = "hover")
```

I studied all the reasons for bus delays, but only included the three most noteworthy: mechanical, general, and vision. I then plotted the data over time and found no correlation between the time of year and the type of delay.

```{r incident_list,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
incident_list <- c("Mechanical", "General Delay", "Vision")

# Create a list of ggplot objects for each incident
plot_list <- lapply(incident_list, function(incident_type) {
  ggplot(subset(ttc, incident == incident_type), aes(x = date, y = min_delay)) +
    geom_point(color = "black") +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    scale_x_date(
      date_breaks = "1 month",
      date_labels = "%b %Y",
      limits = c(min(ttc$date), max(ttc$date))
    ) +
    labs(
      title = paste("Relationship between Date and Bus Delay (Incident:", incident_type, ")"),
      x = "Date",
      y = "Min Delay"
    )
})

# Combine the plots using facet_wrap
final_plot <- do.call(gridExtra::grid.arrange, c(plot_list, ncol = 1))

```

# Does time of day impact bus schedules?

In Toronto, buses operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The bus schedule may vary depending on the day of the week and the time of year. One question that arises is whether the time of day affects the likelihood of a bus being late.

```{r time, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(ttc, aes(x = time_2, y = min_delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  # Customize x-axis breaks and labels
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 3),  # Adjust the breaks as needed
    labels = c("12:00 AM", "3:00 AM", "6:00 AM", "9:00 AM", "12:00 PM", "3:00 PM", "6:00 PM", "9:00 PM", "12:00 AM")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Time of Day and Bus Delay",
    x = "Time of Day",
    y = "Min Delay"
  )

```

# Does rush hour impact bus schedules?

During rush hour, which is typically between **7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.**, are buses more likely to be late?

```{r busy_times,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# Create a factor for rush hour
ttc$rush_hour <- ifelse((ttc$time_2 >= 7 & ttc$time_2 <= 9) | (ttc$time_2 >= 17 & ttc$time_2 <= 19), "Rush Hour", "Non-Rush Hour")

# Visualize the relationship with rush hour times highlighted
ggplot(ttc, aes(x = time_2, y = min_delay, color = rush_hour)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  # Customize x-axis breaks and labels
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 24, by = 3),  # Adjust the breaks as needed
    labels = c("12:00 AM", "3:00 AM", "6:00 AM", "9:00 AM", "12:00 PM", "3:00 PM", "6:00 PM", "9:00 PM", "12:00 AM")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Time of Day and Bus Delay",
    x = "Time of Day",
    y = "Min Delay"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()


```

# The bus is most likely to be late on which day of the week?

```{r day of week,message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# On what day is the bus most likey going to be late? 
# Calculate the average delay for each day of the week?
# Create an ordered factor for days of the week
ttc$day <- factor(ttc$day, levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))

# Calculate the average delay for each day of the week
average_delays <- ttc %>%
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(AvgDelay = mean(min_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

# Bar plot to visualize the average delays
ggplot(average_delays, aes(x = day, y = AvgDelay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Average Delay by Day of the Week",
       x = "Day of the Week",
       y = "Average Delay (Minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()

```
The bus is most likely to be late on Sunday, with an average delay of 25 minutes. The least likely day for the bus to be late is Tuesday, with an average delay of only 17 minutes.


# All Bus routes

There are 224 bus routes in this data set.

```{r violin,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,}

# Calculate order of routes based on max min_delay

# Late Busses

  ) +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
```

# On Time Busses

Is there a particular bus route that is more on time than others?

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE}
# Calculate the mean delay for each route
all_route_delay <- ttc %>%
  group_by(route) %>%
  summarise(MeanDelay = mean(min_delay))

# Sort routes by mean delay in descending order
all_route_delay_summary <- all_route_delay %>%
  arrange(desc(MeanDelay))


# what routs are on time the most often 
route_mean_on_time <- ttc %>%
  group_by(route) %>%
  summarise(MeanDelay = mean(min_delay, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%
  arrange(MeanDelay) %>%
  head(10)

# Create a bar plot to display the routes with the 10 lowest mean delays
#
ggplot(route_mean_on_time, aes(x = reorder(route,MeanDelay,decreasing=TRUE),route, y = MeanDelay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightgreen", color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Routes with Lowest Mean Delay (Most On-Time Routes)",
    x = "Route",
    y = "Mean Delay (Minutes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels
```


The model predicts the average {min_delay} to be **54851.09	mins**.

 **A p-value of 0.0268**, is less than the commonly used significance level of 0.05. This suggests that there is evidence to **reject** the null hypothesis that the intercept is zero.

 .
```{r summary,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##model time_2
timemodel <- lm(min_delay ~ time_posi, data = ttc)

# Summary of the model
tidy_summary <- broom::tidy(timemodel)

# Round the numeric columns to 2 decimal places
tidy_summary <- tidy_summary %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~round(., 2)))

# Display the rounded summary using kable
tidy_summary %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(lightable_options = "hover")

```


```{r report,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
report::report(timemodel)
