## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, warning=FALSE}
skim(tcc)
```



## Is a particular bus route that is more late than others?

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Is a particular route more late than others?
route_mean_delays <- tcc %>%
  group_by(route) %>%
  summarise(MeanDelay = mean(min_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(MeanDelay)) %>%
  head(10)

# Create a bar plot to display the routes with the 10 highest mean delays
ggplot(route_mean_delays, aes(x = reorder(route,MeanDelay,decreasing=FALSE), y = MeanDelay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "red", color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Routes with Highest Mean Delay",
    x = "Route",
    y = "Mean Delay (Minutes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
```



## Is a particular bus route that is more on time than others?

```{r pressure2, echo=FALSE}
# Calculate the mean delay for each route
all_route_delay <- tcc %>%
  group_by(route) %>%
  summarise(MeanDelay = mean(min_delay))

# Sort routes by mean delay in descending order
all_route_delay_summary <- all_route_delay %>%
  arrange(desc(MeanDelay))


# what routs are on time the most often 
route_mean_on_time <- tcc %>%
  group_by(route) %>%
  summarise(MeanDelay = mean(min_delay, na.rm = FALSE)) %>%
  arrange(MeanDelay) %>%
  head(10)

# Create a bar plot to display the routes with the 10 lowest mean delays
#
ggplot(route_mean_on_time, aes(x = reorder(route,MeanDelay,decedinding=TRUE),route, y = MeanDelay)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "lightgreen", color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Routes with Lowest Mean Delay (Most On-Time Routes)",
    x = "Route",
    y = "Mean Delay (Minutes)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
